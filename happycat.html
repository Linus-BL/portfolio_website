                    HappyCat was the name of the project in the course "Design och tjänsteutveckling för Internet of Things". The task for
                    the project was to build and implement an IoT system that solves a problem, and the case needed to be Smart
                    Room/Building related.

                    In my group, we were 4 students and our solution was HappyCat, a cat monitoring system that would give the cat owner
                    information about their cat, and a way to know what their cat is doing while they are not home. We built and coded a
                    scale that measured how much food the cat ate (precise to half a gram) and a motion detection system with the help of
                    PIR sensors to know when and how much the cat used the litter box.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    All this information was published on a website so the owner could keep track of their cat.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My main task in this project was to build and code the scales with the help of one of the other group members. To do
                    this we used raspberries pies, loading-cell, esp32s, and open-source C libraries, and a lot of soldering.
