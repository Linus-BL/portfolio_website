                <p>DCT Studio is a hair salon in Örnsködsvik and when they opened their business they were in the need
                    of a website. They
                    contacted me and asked if I could help them with their website, and of course, my answer was yes.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We started talking about what they needed and wanted on the website and what some of the general
                    stylings would be. But
                    they were not sure what they wanted except for information about their website and some pictures so
                    they gave me a
                    pretty wide range to work with.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The first thing I did was to look for a color scheme and font that would fit the rest of the feel
                    and impression of the
                    website, and after some talking with the customer I found a color scheme that they were really happy
                    with. After that, I
                    started with making some lo-fi designs and after some iterations both me and the customer were happy
                    with how the
                    information would be displayed.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Then the implementation started and it went pretty well. No major problems occurred and the time
                    frame the customer had
                    given me was held. When the implementation was done the customer also asked if I could help them
                    figure out how to host
                    the website and connect the website with their domain name. This was a challenge for me because it
                    was the first time I did
                    this but after some time I figured it out and got the website up and running.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This was a very special project for me because it was the first time I worked with a customer
                    outside of school, and to
                    see my webpage be used by a real company was an amazing feeling.
