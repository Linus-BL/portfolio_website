                    For the course "Produktutveckling i medieteknik med metoden "Design-Build-Test" I and 3 other students created a new
                    design for a food delivery app and a proof of concept implementation for how restaurants could set their delivery area.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The course consisted of one big project and the project had to be connected with a company. We were tasked with finding
                    the company to work with by ourselves and my group contacted Thnx Innovations and worked with them. We as a group had
                    talked about some sort of food app before we talked with Thnx, and they already had a project with a food delivery
                    application that we continued to work with.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We started by doing a preliminary investigation about what the users wanted with a food ordering application. Then we
                    did a lo-fi prototype and tested it with users and iterated the design. After we and the customer were happy with the
                    results we started with the hi-fi prototype. All group members did their own hi-fi prototype then we took the best parts
                    of each design and made a design that looked complete. Then we once again did a couple of rounds of user testing and
                    design iteration until all parts were happy.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After the design was done we started with making a Proof of Concept implementation of how the restaurants could decide
                    their delivery area. To be continued... (the project is still in the works)
